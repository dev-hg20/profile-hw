# 02 Responsive Portfolio

## Description

Utilising Bootstrap, I created my profile consisting of the following pages

- index
- portfolio
- contact

Overall, I minimised the used of media queries and kept to the creating a layout, navigation and images to be responsive. I utilised bootstrap's grid system to maintain my layout and tried to maintain a similar layout throughout the three pages. I also utilised google fonts to have a consistent heading throughout the pages so it had a flow across the pages.

## Fun Call Outs

#### Index

I thought I'd add a card to the layout on the side to bring dimension to the page and I linked it to my portfolio through the button. In my about me section I also tried to use a similar font as h1 for consistency purposes. I've also made the card responsive

#### Navigation Bar

For the navigation bar, I created anchor links to the three pages respectively. I also made the navbar responsive so it had a toggle icon that dropped down when minimised to a small screen. The dropdown is available by hovering on the icon and it highlights your page of choice and is also anchored.
